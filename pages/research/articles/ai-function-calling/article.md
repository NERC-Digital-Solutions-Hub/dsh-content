# AI Function Calling

Don't waste time navigating applications or writing complex queries - let AI do that for you.

We’ve been exploring AI function calling as a way to help users find answers more quickly and effectively. Below, we showcase an early prototype demonstrating how function calling can enchance our UPRN service.

Our first experiment tested whether AI function calling could be used to filter UPRNs by ward and control the map view, such as zooming in and out.

We then extended this to allow filtering by specific areas.

Next, we tackled a more complex challenge — using AI to filter UPRNs based on pollutant levels.
This demonstrates how AI can handle more advanced, data-driven queries seamlessly.

Finally, we explored how users might download filtered data directly through the AI-enabled UPRN service, completing a full end-to-end workflow.

Our research shows that AI function calling offers a simpler, more effective way to query and interact with data.
We believe this approach represents a significant step forward — and a glimpse into the future of working with geospatial data.
